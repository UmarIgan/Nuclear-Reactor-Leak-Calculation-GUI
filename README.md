# Nuclear-Reactor-Leak-Calculation-GUI
This program calculate the effect of a nuclear leak based on distance, Wind's speed and the Radioactive material 
It is a gui and open source so it can be improve by adding some graph and simulations. In this program Ä± used  St-90 as radioactive material since most reactors leaks it.
There is an embedded graph data inside the codes which calculated with 12 g/s leak of St-90.
I used the main wind speeds because there is no big difference when i use it exactly.
